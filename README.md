# FoodDataViewer


This one was a really nice course to take on. 
Application is not very sophisticated but I like the idea of checking food composition based on barcode.
Barcode detection is based on Firebase features. Based on the detected barcode it sends http request to
Open Food Facts API to get information about our food from there. Thanks to this I could get some exercise with Retrofit 
and Moshi.
Also I could practice my testing skills, both- Unit and Instrumented testing.
The instrumented tests provided in Espresso were pretty tough as they required mocking API responses and database, I bieleve I've learnt 
very much from these.


Major features:
- Spotify Mobius framework supporting MVI architecture
- RxJava2,
- Dagger2,
- Firebase, MLKit (barcode scanning)
- Retrofit,
- Room database
- JUnit, Mockito, Espresso
